## Description

This is an Android Studio project that uses a Firebase database. Users can create accounts and then navigate the globe searching and scanning QR codes or barcodes. When they scan one, they will get a score based on the code's hash, and the user will have the option of taking a picture of the object they scanned and/or tracking its location. Users can comment on one another's posts/scans, as well as navigate a map to see where other scans have taken place. There is a leaderboard regarding the score and scans. There is also an app owner who can delete anyone's post/scan if they are malicious, as well as delete users for bad behaviors.
